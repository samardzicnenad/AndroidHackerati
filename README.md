# <b>The Hackerati Android course</b>

<b>01) Greeting in Tongues</b> - My first android app (advanced version of traditional 'Hello world!')

For the selected list of languages, when related button pressed, the application shows the translation of 'Hello world!' to the appropriate language (Thanks, Google Translate).

The inspiration for the application name was the Talking Heads album, so I nicked the artwork for the icon, as well.

<b>02) Three Card Monte</b> - An example of communication between activities

The Queen of Spades wins - try to guess where it is!

The app shuffles the cards and shows the card face when a card back is pressed. Card images are being used.

I've considered implementing a 'hustle mode' which doesn't allow you to win, but this is left as an improvement for one of the future versions. You're safe ;) !

<b>03) Solar ListView</b> - Using a custom adapter to build a ListView of the Solar system celestial bodies

The application groups the Solar system planets together with their moons, randomizes the position of the group in the list and randomizes the background color of the group.

Every item in the ListView contains a celestial body's name and image.

When the item is pressed, the app opens the page for that celestial body in the web browser.

I have used both images and the pages from http://www.seasky.org.
